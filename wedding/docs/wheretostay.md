# Where to Stay

We've put together a list of ideas for places to stay whilst you're visiting Manchester.

Whitworth Art Gallery is located in the south of central Manchester. There are many accommodation options in the city centre which is a short taxi or bus ride away, or a 30-40 minute walk. We suggest checking out [airbnb](https://airbnb.co.uk) or [booking.com](https://booking.com) for loads of great places to stay to suit any group size or budget.

## Hotels

In addition, there are a few hotels a 15 minute walk or less from the reception venue:

### Hyatt Regency - Manchester Oxford Road

The Gallery have provided us with a discount code for bookings at the Hyatt.

To book, head to the [Hyatts Manchester Website](https://hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/england-united-kingdom/hyatt-regency-manchester/manrm), click ‘Book Now’, select your dates / people etc. and then look for the ‘Special rate’ option.
