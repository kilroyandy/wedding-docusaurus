## Dress Code

Dress code for the reception is **formal**. We'd love everyone to dress up for the occasion but know there may be some confusion as this is a reception and not a ceremony. If helpful, just think "I'm off to a wedding, I should put on my wedding clothes" and you'll be grand ðŸ˜Š.


## Arrival - from 4:30 pm

We'll be able to accept folks into the building for the reception from 4:30 pm.

Please enter at the front entrance of the building and a member of the gallery staff will direct you to the Pink Gallery.
