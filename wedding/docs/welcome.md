Hi! Welcome to our website ðŸ˜Š

As you may know, our Civil Partnership ceremony will take place on the 15th of September with just us and our witnesses in attendance. However we look forward to celebrating with you all on Saturday 17th September with food, drinks, music, and dancing!

On here youâ€™ll find the schedule for the day, how to get there, some ideas for where to stay and also some fun stuff to do in Manchester if youâ€™re staying longer.

If you have any questions about the day, or need to get in touch with us, you can find our contact details [here](contact.md).
