Due to the 'bus gates' on Oxford Road, general traffic is prohibited on Oxford Road between Hathersage Road and Portland Street, between 6am and 9pm, 7 days a-week.
Black cabs and Taxis etc are allowed down this road with no restrictions.

Visitors driving from South Manchester via Wilmslow Road are advised to turn left at Moss Lane East, right at Lloyd Street North and then right onto Denmark Road.
